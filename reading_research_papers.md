# Notes on Reading Research Papers

## General Steps

Step 1. Literature Overview

- compile list of papers (+ medium posts, other blog posts, etc)
- skip around the list. Don't try to read all of them at once.

Step 2. Read

- do multiple passes on each paper, getting into more detail in each of them
- what to read in pass 1: title          abstract     figures
- what to read in pass 2: introduction   conclusion   figures   skim rest (skip related word)
- what to read in pass 3: read all, but skip math
- what to read in pass 4: read all, but skip parts that don't make sense

## You have understood the paper if you can answer the following questions

- What did the authors try to accomplish?
- What were the key elements of the approach?
- What can you use yourself?
- What other references do you want to follow?

## Sources of papers

- ML subreddit
- conferences: NIPS / ICML / ICLR (look at the papers that are going to be presented there)
- friends
- arxiv

## Tips and tricks

- If you want basic understanding, read 5  - 20  papers
- If you want very good understanding, read 50 - 100 papers
- Math: rederive from scratch
- Code:
  - run open-source code
  - reimplement from scratch

> **Long term advice**: Do steady reading, not short bursts.
